* Project Euler in Common Lisp
  This is the progress of me solving [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler problems]] to learn Common
  Lisp.

  I am in no way an expert at Common Lisp or Programming. This is for my
  practice. Altough you could use some tips I scattered throughout the project.
