* Description
  This is the progress of me solving [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler problems]] to learn Common
  Lisp.

  I used Nix for management and so that I don't have to install extra
  programming stuff to my computer. If you don't care about Nix, then just
  ignore/delete the =.envrc= and =shell.nix= files.

  I am in no way an expert at Common Lisp. This is for my practice, Altough you
  could use some tips I scattered throughout the project.
